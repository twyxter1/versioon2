        1. Kanban is a very simple and easy to understand system that makes it practical for the management of a company to apply this system effectively.
    </td>

    <td>
         1. Kanban cannot be used as an independent tool. It is not a methodology that could be applied solely rather it can be merged with other processes and systems of a company like JIT, make to order and scrum etc. making these systems more visible.
    </td>

    <td>
        2. The main advantage of applying the kanban system is a direct reduction in the costs and wastage of the company. Kanban system improves the flow and management of inventory by directly assisting the company to pursue the companyâ€™s existing systems i.e. just in time (JIT) and make to order etc. which reduces carrying or holding costs and makes sure smoother running of inventories.
    </td>

    <td>
        2. As the tasks are continuously shifted between the columns of kanban board, the prediction of specific timelines for completion of tasks or activities becomes difficult. This is because kanban acts only as a signaling port in a pull production system.
    </td>

<tr>
    <td>
        3. Kanban system advocates continuous and sustainable improvements in the production systems of the company. Kanban not only consist of manual guidelines or cards but also visualizations of the process outputs which makes the review of work easier. This could also highlight other potential problematic areas where additional attention is needed.
    </td>

    <td>
        3. Kanban is not suitable for the environments that are dynamic in nature. Because a kanban system assumes the plans that are stable and consistent to a certain extent, it may become ineffective in industries where the activities are not static.
